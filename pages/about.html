        <h3 class="centertext"> The Website and my Work </h3>
        <p class="p"> &nbsp; This website functions as a place to store my best works so that buisnesses and clients may take intrest in my abilities. The site itself functions as part of portfolio as well as a navigation tool for site viewers. My construction of the site took several days of preperation and sketching before I decided what I wanted it to look like. The final result is the site you are currently viewing.
        </p>
        <h3 class="centertext"> About Myself </h3>
        <p class="p"> &nbsp; I have always been intrested in art and the creation of intresting images and visuals since I was a young child, and following that desire I have regularly tackled problems in creative or thoughtful manners in an effort to hone my brain. I currently attend Cal State University East Bay as a Junior with a 3.6+ GPA and aim to continue to improve myself and my work.
        </p>
        <h3 class="centertext"> About the Code </h3>
        <p class="p"> This entire site was coded using the Zerb Foundation 6 cell system as a starting point, then the insertion of code and css was done by myself.
